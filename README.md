## Syntax
```
NumeralSystemConverter.jar
```

## Stages
**Stage 1 For example**  
Start with outputs and the binary system: print a line with an example conversion.

**Stage 2 Almost an octopus**  
Learn the basics of working with Scanner class: teach the converter to determine the last digit of the octal number, converted from the decimal system.

**Stage 3 Convert decimals**  
With the help of switch operator and prefixes, convert the number to any system of your choice.

**Stage 4 Any which radix**  
Upgrade your converter: enable it to convert numbers from and to any numeral system. Practice arrays, loops and strings.

**Stage 5 Converting fractions**  
Make it possible for the converter to work with fractions as well (that is, float and double datatypes).

**Stage 6 Error!**  
Mistakes are inevitable: teach your converter to handle them and report errors if they occur.
